# Sentiment-Analysis

This project implements a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using TensorFlow.

## Features

• Uses an RNN with stacked SimpleRNN cells for text classification.

• Processes text data with word embeddings, padding, and batching.

• Trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset for binary sentiment classification.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run training: python sentiment_analysis_cell.py

3. Evaluate performance on the test dataset.

## Future Improvements

• Implement LSTM/GRU for better sequence modeling.

• Fine-tune word embeddings with pre-trained models.

• Optimize hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
